#EventFinder-Android

An EventFinder application made using Angular with a Node Backend. It fetches data from the TicketMaster api.

The user is presented with a searchform where they input the keyword, radius of search, category of desired events, and the location (auto-detect location allowed). The webpage then presents a list of events matching the criteria. The user can then get event, venue and artist details for each event.
